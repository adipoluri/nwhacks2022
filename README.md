# Quizify Music Guessing Game

Quizify is a fun multiplayer Song Trivia game implemented with node.js, Express.js, and socket.io for the Back-end architecture, and pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end. Quizify utilises the spotify API aswell as the Musicxmatch api to pull random facts from various songs from different genres that are used to quiz the players. To play, all you need to do is create a lobby, get some friends to join (or go in solo), and let the DJ queue up some tunes. The questions will show up on the screen, answer it correctly before the time runs out and compete against your friends.

This hackathon was a great learning experience for the three of us and we had a blast putting it together. We look forward to taking this experience and trying even harder at a future hackathon.
